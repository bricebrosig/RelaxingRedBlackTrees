Assignment 1 problem 2

Use the makefile to run this program! simply type make than then use ./proj2 to run the executable. This will avoid the messy compilation that is
required for this program. 

If you have any questions or any problems compiling, running, or reading this program please do not
hesitate to email me at bricebrosig@my.unt.edu

Note that the output is simply the black height, height, and run time for each algorithm. to get the data i just
ran the program 6 times and took down the data.

Thanks and have fun!
